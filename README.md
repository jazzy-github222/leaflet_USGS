# Funding Our Future: USGS Insights 🍀

## Introduction 👩‍💻
Hey, my name is Jazzy the Creator of this code! Check out my beautiful graph in the images folder!

## Background 🌅
In my work, I specialize in keeping tabs on earthquakes of magnitude 4.5 and higher that have occurred in the past seven days. Partnering with the US Geological Survey, we've developed a user-friendly visualization tool. It's not just about understanding; it's about rallying everyone to protect our planet's future.

## Analysis 🔍
The geological data is similar in size due to similar magnitidues and difference in colour based on depth.

## Happy Coding 🎉
